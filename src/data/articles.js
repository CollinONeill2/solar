The formation was cause by the collapse of a giant molecular cloud, the mass at the centre collecting to form the Sun and a flat disk of dust around it which the planets and other bodies would eventually be formed from.'

Eventually, the view that the Sun was at the centre of the universe was postulated by Copernicus, though this is also not the case.'
